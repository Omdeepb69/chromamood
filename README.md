# ChromaMood

## Description
Analyzes the dominant colors in a live webcam feed or static image and suggests a mood or generates abstract art based on the color palette.

## Features
- Real-time color analysis from webcam feed using OpenCV.
- Dominant color extraction using K-Means clustering on pixel values.
- Mapping extracted color palettes to predefined moods (e.g., warm colors -> energetic, cool colors -> calm).
- Optional: Generate simple abstract visuals (e.g., colored stripes/blocks) based on the detected palette.
- Display dominant colors and suggested mood.

## Learning Benefits
Understand practical color analysis in images/video, apply K-Means clustering for feature extraction (color quantization), work with real-time video streams via OpenCV, and practice basic image manipulation.

## Technologies Used
